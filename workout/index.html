  <title>DRY MTN /\ Invite. To. Make. Be. Leave. Work. Out. /\ </title>
  <meta name="description" content="DRY MTN was born in the high desert by three artists longing to experiment and create tangible artifacts that will motivate and inspire our community to create. We are creating a large format print publication focused on photography and screen printing to become a vehicle that melds our vastly differing Socio-Historic and artistic backgrounds. This tri-cultural amalgamation will be celebrated with the community in collaborative environments where participants screen print issues for themselves and others. These popup printing parties open up a dialogue and create an environment that erases ownership, blurs semiotic languages and the artist’s Absolute Intention.">
